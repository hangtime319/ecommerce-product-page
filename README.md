# E-commerce Product Page

A responsive and interactive e-commerce product page, built as a challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "E-commerce product page" challenge. It's a highly interactive and fully responsive page designed to showcase a single product. The core focus of this project was on implementing dynamic functionalities using **JavaScript**, including a functional image gallery with a lightbox, a quantity selector, and a working shopping cart that adds and removes items. The project also prioritizes a clean and modern user interface and adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the product page, including product details, image gallery, and cart elements.
* **CSS3:** For all the styling, including a responsive grid and flexbox layout, animations for the lightbox, and custom properties for colors and typography.
* **JavaScript:** This is the key technology for all interactive features:
    * Handling the image gallery and thumbnail selection.
    * Toggling the lightbox/modal for a larger view of the images.
    * Managing the quantity of items selected.
    * Implementing the "Add to Cart" and cart management logic (adding, displaying, and removing items).
